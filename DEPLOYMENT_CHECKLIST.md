# ✅ Repository Ready for GitHub!

## Final Structure Summary

Your Exercise 8 repository is now properly configured for GitHub Codespaces with auto-downloading data.

### 📁 What's Committed to GitHub (Small Files Only):

```
exercise-8-nacc-analysis/
├── Exercise8.ipynb                      ← Main notebook

└── figs/
    └── .gitkeep                        ← Output folder

Total repository size: ~2.5 MB
```

### 🚫 What's NOT Committed (Auto-Downloaded):

- ❌ `data/sub-s00X/func/*.nii` - BOLD files (~143MB each)
- ❌ `data/sub-s00X/func/*.nii.gz` - Compressed BOLD (~300MB each)
- ❌ `data/sub-s00X/func/*.tsv` - Events files (~7KB each)
- ❌ `figs/*.png` - Generated plots
- ❌ Old `sub-s001/` and `sub-s002/` folders in root (can be deleted after git commit)

## 🎯 How It Works for Students

1. **Student opens repo in Codespaces** → Environment builds automatically
2. **Student opens Exercise8.ipynb** → Jupyter opens in VS Code
3. **Student selects subject**: Changes `SUBJECT = "sub-s001"` (or 002, 003, 004)
4. **Student runs notebook** → Auto-download cell fetches their subject's data:
   ```
   🔍 Checking data files for sub-s001...
   ⬇️  Downloading sub-s001_task-mid_run-01_bold.nii.gz...
   📦 Decompressing to sub-s001_task-mid_run-01_bold.nii...
   ✅ Downloaded successfully
   ```
5. **Data cached** → Subsequent runs are instant (uses cached files)
6. **Analysis runs** → Generates plots in `figs/` folder

## 📝 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Clean Up (Optional)
The old `sub-s001/` and `sub-s002/` folders in the root directory are no longer needed:
- Close Exercise8.ipynb in VS Code to release file locks
- Delete these folders manually via File Explorer
- They're already in `.gitignore` so they won't be committed

### 2. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd "c:\Users\jliss\Downloads\Exercise 9"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Exercise 8 NAcc reward processing analysis"
```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Option A: Via GitHub CLI
gh repo create exercise-8-nacc-analysis --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Option B: Via GitHub web interface
# 1. Go to github.com/new
# 2. Name it "exercise-8-nacc-analysis"
# 3. Don't initialize with README (we have one)
# 4. Create repository
# 5. Follow instructions to push existing repository
```

### 4. Test in Codespaces
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main"
5. Wait ~2-3 minutes for build
6. Open Exercise8.ipynb
7. Run all cells to verify auto-download works

### 5. Update README Badge (After Testing)
Replace the badge URL in README.md:
```markdown
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/exercise-8-nacc-analysis)
```

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Tiny repository** - Only 2.5 MB committed (vs 1+ GB with data)  
✅ **Auto-download** - Data fetches from OpenNeuro on first run  
✅ **Student choice** - 4 subjects available, each picks one  
✅ **Fast re-runs** - Cached data makes subsequent analyses instant  
✅ **Codespaces ready** - One-click environment setup  
✅ **Professional structure** - Clean separation of code and data  
✅ **Well documented** - README, SETUP, and inline comments

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Process cannot access file" errors when deleting old folders:**
- Close Exercise8.ipynb in VS Code
- Close any terminals that might be using those directories
- Try deleting via File Explorer instead of PowerShell

**Want to verify .gitignore is working:**
```bash
git status
# Should NOT show data/sub-s00X/func/*.nii or *.nii.gz files
# Should NOT show sub-s001/ or sub-s002/ in root
```

**To see what will be committed:**
```bash
git add -n .
# Shows what would be added (dry run)
```

## 🎓 For Students: Expected Workflow

1. Fork or clone the repository
2. Open in GitHub Codespaces (click badge in README)
3. Wait for environment to build
4. Open Exercise8.ipynb
5. Choose subject: `SUBJECT = "sub-s001"` (or 002, 003, 004)
6. Run all cells:
   - First run: Downloads data (~2-4 minutes for BOLD file)
   - Subsequent runs: Instant (uses cached data)
7. View generated plots in `figs/` folder
8. Complete analysis and interpretation

**Your repository is now ready for deployment! 🚀**

The structure ensures students get a seamless experience while keeping your GitHub repository lean and professional.
